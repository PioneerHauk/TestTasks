Develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model to sort categories of ID codes extracted from scanned insurance documents.

Create a model named OCRModel in PyTorch. It should have the following specifications:

A network architecture with different layers to ingest both the image and the type. The layers relative to the image should be saved as a sequential module called image_layer, and compatible the input dimensions of the images (64x64 pixels size).
A Conv2d layer with kernel size 3x3, padding 1, and appropriate in/out channels.

Train the Model: call the model as model and use an appropriate optimizer and loss function to train it. Iterate through your training for ten epochs.
