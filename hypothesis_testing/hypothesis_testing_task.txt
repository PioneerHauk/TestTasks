Perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine the p-value, and hence result, of whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis
that the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's. Use 10% significance level.

The p-value and the result of the test must be stored in a dictionary called result_dict in the form:
result_dict = {"p_val": p_val, "result": result}
where p_val is the p-value and result is either the string "fail to reject" or "reject", depending on the result of the test
