Inspect 'Online Retail.csv' dataset. Build a forecasting model using PySpark to predict 'Quantity' of products sold.

Split the data into two sets based on the splitting date '2011-09-25'. All data up to and including this date should be in the training set, while data after this date should be in the test set.

Using your test set, calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for your forecast model for the 'Quantity' sold. Return a double (float) named 'mae'.

How many units are expected to be sold during the week 39 of 2011? Store as an integer variable called 'quantity_sold_w39'.
